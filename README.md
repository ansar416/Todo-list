This is a front-end-focused e-commerce web app enhanced with Node.js project management.

The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a modular shopping experience.

index.js serves as the main entry point for homepage interactivity.

package.json manages the project's metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

package-lock.json ensures consistent dependency versions across installs.

The app features user authentication via sign-in and sign-up forms.

Product data is stored locally and rendered dynamically.

A responsive navigation bar and image carousel improve UX.

No backend or database is included; this project is front-end only.

Easily run by opening index.html in a browser; no build step required (unless tools are later added).
